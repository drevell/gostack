Go Stack
--------

Go Stack is a goroutine stack profile parsing library and accompanying `gstack`
command for inspecting profiles.

Right now it's just a toy, but maybe someday it will be a useful way to quickly
gather data from goroutine stack profiles.

See [full documentation on godoc](http://godoc.org/github.com/schmichael/gostack).

Or install the `gstack` tool:

```sh
go get -u github.com/schmichael/gostack/cmd/gstack
```
